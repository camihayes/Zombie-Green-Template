{"name":"Zombie-Green Template","tagline":"A website template for showcasing photography and art.","body":"This is my latest website template. It contains a jumbotron heading, three side-by-side informational columns, and a checkerboard body style. \r\n<br>\r\nAs usual I have implemented the framework of [Bootstrap3](http://getbootstrap.com/). I also used [Font Awesome](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Google Fonts](https://www.google.com/fonts#UsePlace:use). \r\n<br>\r\nThis is NOT an actual website and I know very little about adopting pitbulls other that what I watched on the TV series \"Pitbulls and Parloees\". The buttons are ideas; they do not lead anywhere. That's your job!\r\nI prefer to create an actual example website, not just bare bones templates. As you can see from this website, the large image displays have description areas, and by placing the three in this example in alternate patterns achieves the checkerboard effect and gives any display a pleasant viewing experience.\r\n<br>\r\nThe page background is black and the hi-lights are in what I call \"zombie green.\" The jumbotron image shows the effectiveness of a subtle shades-of-grey approach.\r\n<br>\r\nPlease enjoy and share this template; just don't ask me about adopting a pit bull! :)\r\n[Click to view the page only in my Dropbox](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/11121595/zombie-green-template/Pit%20Bull\t%20Rescue.html)\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
