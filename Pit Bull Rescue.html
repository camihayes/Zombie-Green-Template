        <br>
        <p>PitBulls Are Awesome is an organization designed to help match families with the right pit bull. Animal adoption is a commitment that should be carefully thought out. Do you have small children, or elderly members in your family? Do you have cats, dogs or other animals already? What kind of outdoor space do you have? Would it be suited to a larger, older and calmer dog, or a young pup full of everlasting energy? Do you live alone? Do you travel frequently, and would you wish your pet to accompany you more often than not? Odds are, we have the perfect pitbull for you. Our step-by-step process ensures a smooth and successful adoption.</p>
